karbytes_0: "I tend to think of everything in nature as being in the process of oscilating between diametrically opposite values on some spectrum of related values. I think that each of such values is impossible to pin down as some definite point between two extreme opposites of each other. As soon as one tries to measure the state of some object in nature, the attributes of that object change during the propagation of sensory inputs into the observing frame of reference's information processing apparatus and the mental calculations performed by that information processing agent. Such propogation and computational delay creates a layer of obscurity between observational frame of reference (i.e. the subjective component of the interaction) and the natural phenomenon being observed by that observational frame of reference (i.e. the 'a priori' component of that interaction). I think that the physical universe you and I inhabit has matter in it which is always in motion or changing composition (and that no matter in this universe is stagnant across any positive length interval of time within this universe)."

karbytes_1: "I prefer not to limit my thinking to such simplistic heuristics. I do not think everything necessarily has some complementary opposite nor that everything necessarily a constellation of numerical values instead of merely Boolean values such as EXISTS of DOES_NOT_EXIST. I prefer to 'rest' on the notion of a 'void' imbued with immutable and limitless potential (including the potential to generate an absolute void (i.e. something which is entirely nothing and not the potential to manifest something other than itself)). Perhaps a better word for that 'void' is 'undefined' because the word 'undefined' implies something other than purely null (and undefined has the potential to become defined as something more limited than the noumenal realm)."

karbytes_0: "Why are you 'resting' (or interested in the concept of 'rest')?"

karbytes_1: "Rest is the conservation of energy and the minimization of disorder. A certain amount of time spent resting between energy-consuming tasks (especially tasks which are computational and related to abstraction) is necessary to prevent read-write and calculation errors and to allow for more time to plan for anticipated future outcomes. I tend to prioritize time such that I have what I think is an optimal amount of time to rest my mind (which helps to prevent cognitive resource depletion and to increase creative and logical thinking capacities). I value feeling good and performing well on tasks I assign myself to do. Otherwise I would not mind burning myself out as quickly on possible on the first tasks which are assigned to me by any entity."
