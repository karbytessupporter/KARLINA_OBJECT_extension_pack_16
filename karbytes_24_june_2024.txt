Apparently my autonomy and my happiness are a threat to many other people's conceptualization of socioeconomic security. 

Perhaps those people fear that I spend what they think is too much time in solitude outdoors instead of in close proximity to other people who surveil and who interfere with my behavior to an extent which I find to be stifling and detrimental to my (experience-seeking in addition to cyberspace-based intellectual property output) goals.

All that time spent outdoors and without any companion animals (nor chaperones) staying in close physical proximity to me nor instructing me what to do from afar via wireless electromagnetic signal propagation has seemingly enabled me to forge my own adult huma(noid) identity and ontological and ethical frameworks with relatively little hardship brought about primarily by interpersonal conflicts related to socioeconomic and cultural-religious insecurity. 

Related to what I said in the previous paragraph is the hypothesis that I have that many (if not most) people (especially those who I have observed interact with me in ways which pertain to the first paragraph of this note) are strongly compelled by survival instincts to want to impede progress I attempt to make towards my personal goals (even though my personal goals do not pertain to taking away any person's existing freedoms). 

I am not an enemy to anyone's autonomy (or at least I do not mean to be nor want to be such). I am also not intrinsically compelled to seek pleasure through what I think are cruel (i.e. with intent to cause someone other than myself to suffer) or otherwise unethical means. 

I admittedly do not believe that the convictions enumerated in the previous paragraph are what those I consider to be antagonistic towards me also feel a strong intrinsic desire to uphold for themselves. 

(This is related to the idea that a person, X, is only kind and easygoing towards other people if X is sufficiently wealthy and sufficiently (mentally and physically) healthy. Otherwise, X is guaranteed to be a tyrannical brute who would quickly resort to violence (or violating other rules of conduct which X would never knowingly nor willingly violate out of a sufficiently stable sense of self (which necessarily has its own notions of what is noble and what is abhorrent))).

I attribute the "moral weakness" or "low consciousness" qualities which seem pervasive amongst the human species to humans being metaphorically suffocated by too many humans trying to sabotage their competition instead of working towards more individualistic (i.e. self instead of other people as "locus of control") and eudomonia-oriented endeavors (i.e. projects related to curiosity fulfillment, artistic expression, metaphysical experiences, and harmonious interpersonal and civilization-scale operations).

I am not proposing any specific actions be implemented. People are people. Some people seem to be working towards what I think are noble pursuits while most others are either supporting those who do or else they are not contributing positively and significantly to those endeavors. 

The neutrality of nature is oftentimes seen and sought as refuge from the conditional favoritism of humanity (which wields rewards and punishments (which always seem to result in more losses than gains over time) as mechanisms to perpetuate continual dissatisfaction with the current status quo (which seems to maintain the integrity of an active large-scale economy by ensuring that human "turnover rate" is high (because life spans are short (because the economy seems to be rigged to keep people in perpetual states of prolonged poverty (but that may be because the poor tend to sexually reproduce beyond what they have the resources to enthusiastically support (which leads to intergenerational transmission of role-based power struggles within households (the smallest legally recognized unit of civilization) and within other organizations)))))).

(I generally and colloquially (out of habit (and fear of being punished by the most ardent and socioeconomically empowered mongers of militant anthropocentrisim)) use the terms "people" and "humans" interchangeably).
