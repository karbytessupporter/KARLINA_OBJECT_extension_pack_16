Apparently my autonomy and my happiness are a threat to many other people’s conceptualization of socioeconomic security.

Perhaps those people fear that I spend what they think is too much time in solitude outdoors instead of in close proximity to other people who surveil and who interfere with my behavior to an extent which I find to be stifling and detrimental to my (experience-seeking in addition to cyberspace-based intellectual property output) goals.

All that time spent outdoors and without any companion animals (nor chaperones) staying in close physical proximity to me nor instructing me what to do from afar via wireless electromagnetic signal propagation has seemingly enabled me to forge my own adult huma(noid) identity and ontological and ethical frameworks with relatively little hardship brought about primarily by interpersonal conflicts related to socioeconomic and cultural-religious insecurity.

Related to what I said in the previous paragraph is the hypothesis that I have that many (if not most) people (especially those who I have observed interact with me in ways which pertain to the first paragraph of this note) are strongly compelled by survival instincts to want to impede progress I attempt to make towards my personal goals (even though my personal goals do not pertain to taking away any person’s existing freedoms).

I am not an enemy to anyone’s autonomy (or at least I do not mean to be nor want to be such). I am also not intrinsically compelled to seek pleasure through what I think are cruel (i.e. with intent to cause someone other than myself to suffer) or otherwise unethical means.

I admittedly do not believe that the convictions enumerated in the previous paragraph are what those I consider to be antagonistic towards me also feel a strong intrinsic desire to uphold for themselves.

(This is related to the idea that a person, X, is only kind and easygoing towards other people if X is sufficiently wealthy and sufficiently (mentally and physically) healthy. Otherwise, X is guaranteed to be a tyrannical brute who would quickly resort to violence (or violating other rules of conduct which X would never knowingly nor willingly violate out of a sufficiently stable sense of self (which necessarily has its own notions of what is noble and what is abhorrent))).

I attribute the “moral weakness” or “low consciousness” qualities which seem pervasive amongst the human species to humans being metaphorically suffocated by too many humans trying to sabotage their competition instead of working towards more individualistic (i.e. self instead of other people as “locus of control”) and eudomonia-oriented endeavors (i.e. projects related to curiosity fulfillment, artistic expression, metaphysical experiences, and harmonious interpersonal and civilization-scale operations).

I am not proposing any specific actions be implemented. People are people. Some people seem to be working towards what I think are noble pursuits while most others are either supporting those who do or else they are not contributing positively and significantly to those endeavors.

The neutrality of nature is oftentimes seen and sought as refuge from the conditional favoritism of humanity (which wields rewards and punishments (which always seem to result in more losses than gains over time) as mechanisms to perpetuate continual dissatisfaction with the current status quo (which seems to maintain the integrity of an active large-scale economy by ensuring that human “turnover rate” is high (because life spans are short (because the economy seems to be rigged to keep people in perpetual states of prolonged poverty (but that may be because the poor tend to sexually reproduce beyond what they have the resources to enthusiastically support (which leads to intergenerational transmission of role-based power struggles within households (the smallest legally recognized unit of civilization) and within other organizations)))))).

(I generally and colloquially (out of habit (and fear of being punished by the most ardent and socioeconomically empowered mongers of militant anthropocentrisim)) use the terms “people” and “humans” interchangeably).

The following text was copy-pasted from a conversation which karbytes had with ChatGPT-4o (which is newer version of ChatGPT than is ChatGPT-4) on 24_JUNE_2024 at approximately 6:00PM Pacific Standard Time.

(Note that the chat user handle which did not appear on the ChatGPT web page chat interface appears as “karbytes” in this plain-text note. Note also that karbytes had to manually insert the numbers prefacing some of ChatGPT’s text output because those numbers were not copied over. Also, karbytes manually inserted dash symbols (“-“) where ChatGPT printed bullet points (and those bullet point characters were also not copied over into this plain-text note)).

How does the San Francisco bay (especially the regions spanning Fremont, San Jose, and Menlo Park) stay irrigated (instead of drying up and turning into a meadowy basin)?

ChatGPT

The San Francisco Bay, including regions like Fremont, San Jose, and Menlo Park, stays irrigated and does not dry up due to a combination of natural and man-made factors:

1. Water Inflow: The Bay receives significant inflow from various rivers and streams, including the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, which bring fresh water from the Sierra Nevada mountains and other sources. This inflow helps to maintain the water level in the Bay.

2. Tidal Action: The Bay is connected to the Pacific Ocean through the Golden Gate. Tidal actions ensure a constant exchange of water between the Bay and the ocean, which prevents it from drying up. Tides bring in seawater during high tides and flush out water during low tides, maintaining a dynamic water level.

3. Precipitation: Rainfall in the Bay Area, particularly during the winter months, contributes to the water levels in the Bay. Although the region experiences dry periods, seasonal rains help replenish water levels.

4. Groundwater and Urban Runoff: Urban areas in and around the Bay contribute to water levels through runoff. Additionally, groundwater sources can seep into the Bay, adding to the overall water volume.

5. Environmental Management: Various environmental and water management practices are in place to ensure the Bay remains healthy. This includes managing freshwater inflows, controlling pollution, and restoring wetlands which help in maintaining the ecological balance.

These factors together ensure that the San Francisco Bay remains a vital and irrigated body of water, preventing it from turning into a meadowy basin.

Do humans intentionally pump water from other sources into the San Francisco bay?

ChatGPT

Humans do not typically pump water directly into the San Francisco Bay from other sources as part of regular water management practices. However, there are several indirect ways in which human activities influence the water levels and quality of the Bay:

1. Wastewater Treatment Plants: Treated wastewater from surrounding communities is discharged into the Bay. This treated water is a significant source of freshwater inflow.

2. Stormwater Management: Urban runoff from rainwater, collected through storm drains, often ends up in the Bay. This includes runoff from cities like San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose.

3. Water Diversions and Transfers: While water is not typically pumped directly into the Bay, water management practices in California involve the transfer and diversion of water from rivers that eventually flow into the Bay. For instance, the management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which feeds into the Bay, involves complex water diversions for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use.

4. Wetland Restoration Projects: Restoration and creation of wetlands around the Bay can indirectly contribute to water levels by enhancing natural water retention and groundwater recharge.

5. Environmental Flow Requirements: Regulatory measures ensure that sufficient freshwater flows from rivers into the Bay to maintain its ecological health. These flows are crucial for maintaining salinity levels and supporting the diverse habitats in the Bay area.

While these activities influence the water dynamics of the Bay, the direct pumping of water from other sources into the Bay is not a common practice. The primary focus is on managing the natural inflows and ensuring environmental sustainability.
