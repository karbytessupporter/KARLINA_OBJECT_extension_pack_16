<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Software is an interesting category of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information</a>. Not only are the unique objects of software existing only in &#8216;a realm&#8217; which is abstract compared to what you and I refer to as &#8216;the physical realm&#8217;, but also, the entirety of software (specifically, the sequences of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/bits_and_bytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a> which verbatim encode exactly one piece of information) exists in both of those two realms simultaneously (when the software objects are instantiated as &#8216;(computer) meaningful&#8217; sequences comprised of some finite (natural) number of ones and zeroes in the form of specific molecular, atomic, and subatomic particle arrangements within the computer&#8217;s &#8216;solid state&#8217; (relatively unchanging) circuits) in some electronic (or photonic) computer&#8217;s hardware).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;If you can create a three-dimensional scan of each of the hardware (i.e. physical) components of a computer such that each molecule or atom (and perhaps even charge of molecules and atoms) is accounted for by that scan, then you can generate a (functional) software replica of an entire computer which those physical parts could be used to construct and use (in our physical realm). Hence, you can create a software application, X, which people like you and me can use in order to manipulate a virtual replica of a working computer whose entire hardware apparatus and collection of installed firmware and software (i. e. operating system (OS) and OS-dependent applications) is defined by X. Also, X could be installed on a virtual computer defined by X.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;What an interesting phenomenon! That sounds like attempting (and possibly succeeding at) creating a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a> in which multiple universes interact with each other in a manner which I think is very analogous (if not identical) to us simply creating any software object (such as an integer variable for storing the value 5 in a C++ program runtime instance) using either a physical computer or a computer which exists as a virtual object in some software program which we are running on a hardware device.&#8221;</p>
