How do cicadas make those sounds?

ChatGPT

Cicadas produce their distinctive high-pitched sounds using specialized structures called tymbals, located on the sides of their abdominal base. Here’s how the process works:

1. Tymbals: The tymbals are membranes that cicadas can rapidly contract and release using their powerful muscles. These membranes are ribbed and can buckle inward and outward.

2. Muscle Contraction: When the cicada contracts the muscles attached to the tymbals, the tymbals buckle inward, producing a sharp click.

3. Resonance: The rapid contraction and relaxation of the tymbals create a series of clicks that occur in quick succession. These clicks resonate within the cicada’s mostly hollow abdomen, amplifying the sound.

4. Rapid Repetition: The muscle contractions can occur very rapidly, often several hundred times per second, creating the continuous buzzing or droning sound characteristic of cicadas.

5. Species-Specific Songs: Each species of cicada has its unique song or call, which helps individuals of the same species locate each other for mating.

The combination of the tymbals’ structure, the speed of the muscle contractions, and the resonance within the cicada’s body all contribute to the loud and distinctive sounds cicadas are known for.
