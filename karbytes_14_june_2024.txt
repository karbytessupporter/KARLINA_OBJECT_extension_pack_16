karbytes_0: "What is the purpose of existence?"

karbytes_1: "The purpose of existence is itself: existence. Nature exists in order for things in nature to exist. (Pure nothingness is a 'thing' which always exists ubiquitously and independently of any thing which is not also pure nothingness)."

karbytes_0: "Why do some things happen instead of other things?"

karbytes_1: "Every perception and every thought is rendered from exactly one immutably solipsistic frame of reference (though it is hypothetically possible that multiple simultaneously occurring frames of reference render similar if not phenomenally identical informational content). What is rendered for a particular frame of reference is a chronological sequence of transient phenomena (and that frame of reference may be attached to a memory apparatus (in addition to sensory and locomotive apparati) which imbues that frame of reference with a sense of having traversed exactly one historical trajectory for the duration of that frame of reference's existence). The particular chronological sequence of transient phenomena which some uniquely corresponding frame of reference appears to itself to have traversed may or may not be constrained by ubiquitous rules of physics which apply equally to all frames of reference (whether those frames of reference are simultaneously occurring or else are not simultaneously occurring or whether those frames of reference take place inside of separate and non-interacting universes or else take place inside of the same 'universe' (though in this context I mean to imply that a universe is essentially a solipsistic rendering of an information processing agent's own encompassing physical environment which necessarily includes that information processing agent's spatially finite body as part of that modeled environment. (I put the the word 'universe' in quotations because what I meant to imply is something more abstract and less physical: a meta-universe which appears to each of its multiple inhabitating frames of reference to be the same physical environment even though each of those frames of reference renders its own unique and incommunicable depiction of that meta-universe))). To address the question of why things transpire one way instead of some other way, I posit that interdependent components of universes (i.e. solipsistic virtual realities) and of meta-universes (i.e. socially or logistically interactive virtual realities) are in constant flux in order to allow the energy and informational patterns stored within them to be conserved as efficiently as possible. Otherwise, I assume there would only be pure nothingness throughout all existence and absolutely zero phenomena. (What I meant to imply is that pure nothingness is not all there is because such nothingness is not merely the absence of potential for something other than pure nothingness to exist. Instead, pure nothingness has the potential to spontaneously (i.e. without predictable causes) generate physical phenomena which are comprised of finite allocations of matter, energy, time, and space. I assume that whatever phenomena emerge from pure nothingness were selected specifically in order to perpetuate some ongoing energy transfer process which has some fractal-like or pattern-exhibitting components)."

karbytes_0: "Are you suggesting that Nature does not want to be pure nothingness forever?"

karbytes_1: "Yes. I am suggesting that Nature wants whatever is in it to exist exactly as those things do because what exists seems to be Nature's preferred (or available) entertainment modalities. Nature seems to be okay with some phenomena only existing for finite time periods as payment for new phenomena to arise and such that Nature always has something new to behold (even if Nature itself has only a transient or incomplete memory of what transpired within it (because Nature is only as intelligent, memory-filled, and sentient as its physically instantiated information processing agent components are))."

karbytes_0: "Are you suggesting that pure nothingness has any degree of sentience or intelligence?"

karbytes_1: "Yes. I am suggesting that pure nothingness is the most unlimited 'state' of matter. This is obviously different than suggesting that pure nothingness is the complete absence of matter (because what I am suggesting is that all matter is fundamentally comprised of pure nothingness and that matter is a more definite and limited form of pure nothingness than is pure nothingness). Pure nothingness itself might have rudimentary consciousness (i.e. sentience) but I doubt that pure nothingness has much more than rudimentary awareness of existence itself without pure nothingness first instantiating sufficiently many information processing and information routing hardware components. Hence, I could say that Nature did not solve calculus problems until Nature instantiated physical information processing agents which are demonstratively competent at solving calculus problems."

karbytes_0: "What is the purpose of human existence?"

karbytes_2: "The purpose of human existence is to make as many new humans as possible as quickly as possible (which necessitates that some relatively old humans be sacrificed in order to free up material resources which are necessary for sustaining human life) because those with the largest and most physically domineering communities have the most satisfaction out of all the humans."

karbytes_0: "Are you suggesting that high turn over rate and low retention of knowledge (and other human-coveted assets) are markers of a successful human civilization?"

karbytes_2: "To some extent, I am suggesting that it is necessary and therefore good to keep the vast majority of humans as relatively poor and uneducated peasants who do little more than work low-paying jobs and bare and raise their own biological offspring within the context of the smallest permissible unit of human civilization: the nuclear family or multi-generational household (because lone individual adults are generally regarded as excessively unrestrained agents which might inspire other humans to abandon time-honored human traditions which always favor military power as the prerequisite to all other fruits of civilization). A few humans are set aside to be educated more extensively than most other humans are with the goal being that the most educated and talented (and, really, favored by the military-industrial complex) humans do the majority of the technological innovation, policy generation and enforcement, and cultural curation. Given the fact that plenty of highly proficient and specially selected/trained human individuals exist (and always have existed wherever human civilizations ever manifest), all a civilization need do is generate plenty (and preferably a surplus) of fresh, nimble, and easy to indoctrinate new humans every ten to thirty years so that some of those fresh capital can be converted to higher-value stock which governs and serves the larger encompassing civilization's infrastructure (and generalized human welfare (with some individual humans necessarily sacrificed))."

karbytes_0: "Are humans who become biological (or even adoptive) parents of human minors considered to be more worthy of being saved from dying or suffering than are humans who 'choose' to remain childless (especially as single and never married adults) by humans in general?"
